"""
Nested if-else conditions.

--> A nested if-else condition refers to an if statement inside other if or else block. The structure allows for 
    multiple level of decision-making, where one condition is checked inside another.

    Concept :  
                If the outer if condition is True, the inner if statement is evaluated.

                If the outer condition is False, the inner statements are skipped.

                The inner if block can contain its own if,elif, or else statements.

    Uses :
                Checking multiple dependent conditions. 

                Complex decision-making in application.

                Validating input based on multiple criteria.

    Nested if-else conditions allows for precise decision-making in complex scenarios where one condition depends 
    on another.
