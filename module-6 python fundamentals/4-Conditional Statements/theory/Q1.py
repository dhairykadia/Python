â€¢ Introduction to conditionalstatements: if, else, elif.

1) if statment: The if statment is used to execute a block of code when a specified condition evaluation to True.
                if the condition is false,the block skipped.

2) if-else statement :  The if-else statement provides an alternative execution path. if condition is True, the corresponding
                        block runs, otherwise, the else block executes.

3) if-elif-else statement : The if-elif-else statement is used when multiple conditions need to be checked 
                            sequentially. The elif block allows checking additional conditions. if none of the conditions 
                            are True, the else block runs.
