--> Understanding how genrators work in python

    Generators in pyhton are a special type of iterable,like lists or tuple,but they differ in how they produce
    their elements. the allows for efficient computation by generating iteam one at a time , rather than computing
    all items at once and sroring them in memory.

    1) what are genrators?

                genrators are functions that return an itreator and use the yield keyword to produce a sequence of values
                lazily one at a time.

                unlike normal functions that terminate with  a return statment, a generator function saves its safe after
                each yiled and can resume from whrer it left off.
    
    2) key features of generators

                Lazy Evaluation : Generators produce items only when requested,saving memory and imporving perfomance,
                especially for large data base.

                state perservation : after yielding a value,the function pauses execution and retains local variable,
                so it can continue from the same point when called again.

                Efficient iteration : No need to compute or store all items at once

    3) Benefits of Generators 

            Memory Efficiency : Generatord produce one item at a time, making them ideal for large data sets or infinite sequences 
            where stroing the entire list in memory would be impractical.

            Lazy Evaluation : Only generate values as needed, which can lead to performance improvemnts in scenarios where some
            values may never be used.

            Cleaner Code : Often, generators can replace complex itrator logic whith cleaner, more initutive function.

    4) Generators Expressions 

            Similar to list comprehensions, Python also supports a concise syntax to create generators using parantheses instead of
            suqare brackets :

            # Generator expression to yield squares of numbers from 0 to 9
            squares = (x * x for x in range(10))

            This expression creates a generator that computes each square on demand.

    5) When and why to use Generator

            Large Data Sets : When processing huge files or data streams where loading the entire content into memory would be inefficient.

            Infinite Sequence : Generators can model infinite data streams(e.g., continually reading from a network socket) without
            exhausting memory since they generate one element at a time. 

            Data Pipelines : They enable the building of pipelines where data is transformed step-by-step, thus simplifying operations like 
            filtering or mapping without needing intermidate list.

            Generators are a cornerstone of Python's approach to handling itreation and are particularly invaluable in data processing,
            stream handling, and scenarios requiring lazy evaluation. Their ability to pause and resume seamlessly makes your programs 
            flexible, efficient, and often more readable.
