"""
Understanding data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets. 

-->
    Python provides various data types to handle diffrent kinds of data. Understanding 
    these data types is essential for writing effective and efficient python programs.
    Here's an overview of some commonly used data types in python : 

    1.Integer (int)

        Represents whole numbers (positive or negative) without any fractional part.

        Examples :

            Positive numbers : 10,20,30,100

            Negative intergers : -10,-20,-100

            Zero : 0

        Used for counting, indexing, and arithmatic operations where only whole numbers are 
        required.

    2.Float(float)

        Represents numbers with a decimal point (floating-point numbers).

            Examples : 

                Positive floats : 3.14, 14.22, 100.10

                Negative floats : -10.12, -22.14, -30.40

        Used for calculations requiring precision, such as specific computation or measurements.

    3.String (str)

        Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (single,double,or triple quotes).

            Example : 

                Single line strings : "Hello", "hey"

                Multi-line strings :  "" "This is multi line string " ""

        Used for textual data such as names, sentences, or any combination of letters, numbers,
        and symbols.

    4.List (list)

        Represents an ordered, mutable, collection of items. Items can be diffrent data types.

        Example : 

            [1,2,3,4,5]

            ["apple","mango","banana"]

            [14,"hello",22.14]

        Used when you need a collection of items that can be modified.

    5.Tuple(tuple)

        Represents an ordered, immutable collection of items. Likes lists, items can be
        of different data types.

        Example : 
            (1,2,3)

            ("red","green","blue")

        Used for fixed collections of items that should not change.

    6.Dictionary(dict)

        Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable
        (e.g. strings, numbers, tuples)

        Example : 
            {"name" : "Jigs", "Age" : "25"}

        Used to store data that needs to be accessed by unique identifiers(keys).

    7.Set(set)

        Represents an unordered collection of unique items.

        Example : 
            {1,2,3}

            {"apple", "banana", "kiwi"}
