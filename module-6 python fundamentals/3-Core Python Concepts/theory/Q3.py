Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.

-->
    Python operator are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values.
    These operators are essential for performing mathematical, logical, and bit-level operations
    among others. Here, we explore four key types of operators : arithmetic, comparison, logical,
    and bitwise.

    1.Arithmetic Operators

        +  (Addition)                 e.g. 1+4=5
        -  (Substraction)             e.g. 2-2 = 0
        *  (Multiplication)           e.g. 2*2 = 4
        /  (Division)                 e.g. 5/2 = 2.5
        // (Floor Division)           e.g. 5//2 = 2
        %  (Modulous (remainder))     e.g. 5%2 = 1
        * (Exponentiation (power))   e.g. 5*2 = 25

        Arithmetic operators are used in calculations like addition, multiplication, finding
        remainders, or powers.

    2.Comparison Operators 

        Comparison operators compare two values and return boolean result (True or False).

        ==  (Equals to)                  e.g. 5==5 → True
        !=  (Not equals to)              e.g. 5!=3 → True
        >   (Greater than)               e.g. 5 > 3 → True
        <   (Less than)                  e.g. 5 < 3 → False
        >=  (Greater than or equals to)  e.g. 5 >= 5 → True
        <=  (Less than or equals to)     e.g. 5 <= 3 → False

        Comparison operators are commonly used in decision-making structures like if statements 
        to evaluate conditions.

    3.Logical Operators 

        Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean value.

        and (Returns True if both conditions are True)         e.g. (5 > 3) and (3 > 1) → True
        or  (Returns True if at least one condition is True)   e.g. (5 > 3) or (3 < 1) → True
        not (Reverses the Boolean value of a condition)        e.g not(5 > 3) → False

        Logical operators are used in conditional statements to check complex conditions involving
        multiple criteria.

    4.Bitwise operators 

        Bitwise operators perform operations directly on the binary representation of integers. These operators are useful for low-level
        programing tasks, such as manuplating individual bits in data. 

        & (AND)            e.g. 5 & 3 → 1
        | (OR) 
        ^ (XOR)            e.g. 5 ^ 3 → 6
        ~ (NOT)            e.g. ~5 → -6
        << (Left Shift)    e.g. 5 << 1 → 10
        >> (Right Shift)   e.g. 5 >> 1 → 2
