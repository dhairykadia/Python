 How to create variables in Python? 

 -->
    In python, variables are used to store data. They are created by assigning a value to variable
    name using the assignment operator (=). Python automatically determines the variable's datatype
    based on the value assigned.

    Rules for creating variables 

        1. Varibale name rules :

            Must start with a letter (a-z,A-Z) or an underscore(_).

            Cannot start with number.

            Can contain letters, numbers and underscores.

            Cannot contain spaces or special characters.

            Cannot use reserved keywords for e.g. if,else,def.

        2. Case sensitivity :

            Variable names are case sensitive (age and Age both are different variables).

        3. Dynamic typing :

            Python variable do not require a specific type of declared. The type is inferred
            at runtime.
