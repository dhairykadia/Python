"""
How does the Python code structure work?

-->
    1.Modules and imports

        Python programs can use built-in and custom modules.

        imports allows you to use functions, classes, or variables from other files and libraries.


    2.Statements and Expressions

        A statement is an instruction that python code can execute(e.g. print or if).
        
        An expresion is a combination of variabes, operations, and values python evaluates(e.g. x+y).


    3.Indentation

        Python uses indentation to define the structrue of blocks such as loops, functions
        and conditionals.

        Indent using 4 spaces per level (PEP 8 recommendation).

    4.Comments

        Single line comment starts with (#)

        Multi line comment start with using triple quotes.

    5. Functions 

        Function allow you to group reusable blocks of code.

        for example :

        def greet(name):
    
            Function to greet a user.
            
            print(f"Hello, {name}!")

        greet("Alice") 

    6. Classes 

        Classes are used to define custom objects and their behavior.

    7. Control flow

        Python uses Control flow statement like if, for, while to delicate the program's behavior.

    8.File and module structure

        Python files typically have .py extenstion.

        A file can be a standard script or a module that is imported into other scripts.

    9.Execution flow

        Python scripts execute from top to bottom.

        Use the if_name =="main_": block to define the entry point.

    10. Exception handling 

        Python handles errors gracefully using try, except and finally.
