"""
Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python.

-->

    1.Indentations 

        1.Mandatory indentations :

            In Python, Indentations is not optional-- it is a part of the syntax.

            Faliure to properly indent will result in an IndentationError.

        2.Consistent Indentation

            Use the same number of spaces or tabs throught out the code.

            Mixing spaces and tabs is not allowed and will raise an error.

        3.Standard Indentation

            The PEP 8 guidline specific using 4 spaces per indentation level.

        4.Indentations for blocks:

            Indentation is used to group statements into blocks for structure like functions,loops,
            conditional, and classes.

            
    2.Comments 

        Block comments : Use for detailed explanation of section of code.

        Inline comments : Use sparingly, keeping them breif.

        Docstrings : Use triple quotes to describe modules, classes, and functions.


    3.Naming conventions 

        Variable and Functions : Use lowercase names with words seperated by underscores
        (snake_case).

        Classes : Use PascalCase (e.g. MyClass).

        Constants : Use all uppercase letters with words seperated by underscores (e.g. MAX_LIMIT).

        Private variables : Prefix Variable names with an underscore (e.g. _private_var).
