"""
Write a Python program that demonstrates the correct use of indentation, comments, and 
variables following PEP 8 guidelines. 

-->
    Key Aspects Following PEP 8:

        1). Indentation:

            The code uses 4 spaces per indentation level (not tabs).

        2). Comments: Block comments and inline comments are used for clarity.

            Docstrings (" " ") provide explanations for functions and the main program.

        3). Variable Naming:

            Variable names are descriptive and use snake_case.

        4). Constants:

            Constants are named in uppercase (e.g., INCH_TO_CM).

        5). Line Length:

            No line exceeds 79 characters (PEP 8 recommendation).

        6). Whitespace:

            Proper whitespace is used around operators (=, +, *, etc.).

            Blank lines separate logical sections of the code (e.g., between functions).

        7). Modularity:

            The program is broken into functions for reusability and clarity.
