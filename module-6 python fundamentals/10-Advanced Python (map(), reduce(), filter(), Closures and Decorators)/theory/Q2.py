Using map(), reduce(), and filter() functions for processing data.

--> Using `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` Functions for Processing Data

Python provides a set of higher-order functions that are widely used in functional programming. Among them, `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` are particularly important for data processing tasks. 
These functions help apply transformations, filters, and aggregations to data in a concise and efficient manner.

---
1. `map()` Function

- Purpose : Applies a given function to each element of an iterable (e.g., a list) and returns a new iterable with the results.
- Syntax : `map(function, iterable)`
  - `function`: The function to apply to each element.
  - `iterable`: The iterable (e.g., list, tuple) whose elements will be processed.

- How It Works :
  - Each element of the input iterable is passed through the specified function.
  - The output is a `map` object, which can be converted to a list or another iterable type.

- Use Case :
  - Useful for transforming or modifying data.
  - Example: Squaring all elements in a list.

2. `filter()` Function

- Purpose : Filters elements from an iterable based on a condition provided by a function, keeping only the elements that satisfy the condition.
- Syntax : `filter(function, iterable)`
  - `function`: A function that returns `True` or `False` for each element.
  - `iterable`: The iterable to filter.

- How It Works :
  - Each element of the input iterable is tested against the function.
  - Only the elements for which the function returns `True` are included in the output.

- Use Case :
  - Useful for selecting specific data based on criteria.
  - Example: Filtering out even numbers from a list.

3. `reduce()` Function

- Purpose : Reduces an iterable to a single cumulative value by applying a function that takes two arguments.
- Syntax : `reduce(function, iterable)`
  - `function`: A function that takes two arguments and returns a single result.
  - `iterable`: The iterable to be reduced.

- How It Works :
  - The function is applied to the first two elements of the iterable.
  - The result is then combined with the next element, and the process continues until a single value is obtained.
  - **Note**: `reduce()` is part of the `functools` module, so you need to import it first.

- Use Case :
  - Useful for aggregation operations like summation, product, or concatenation.
  - Example: Calculating the product of all elements in a list.

Key Advantages
- `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` make the code more concise and readable by eliminating the need for explicit loops.
- These functions are highly efficient when combined with anonymous `lambda` functions for simple operations.

When to Use Them?
- `map()`: Use it when you want to apply a transformation function to every element in a dataset.
- `filter()`: Use it when you want to extract specific elements based on a condition.
- `reduce()`: Use it when you need to combine all elements into a single result (e.g., summing or multiplying).

These functions are invaluable in scenarios involving functional programming and data processing.
