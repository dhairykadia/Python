"""
Basic operations: concatenation, repetition, string methods (upper(), lower(), etc.).

--> Explanation of basic string operations and commonly used string methods in Python:

---

Basic Operations

1. Concatenation:
   - Combines two or more strings into a single string using the + operator.
   - Example: "Hello" + " " + "World" results in "Hello World".
   - Note: Concatenation only works with strings. Mixing strings with other types (like integers) will cause an error unless explicitly converted using str().

2. Repetition:
   - Repeats a string multiple times using the * operator.
   - Example: "Hi " * 3 results in "Hi Hi Hi ".
   - Useful for creating repeated patterns or formatting text.

Common String Methods

1. upper():
   - Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.
   - Example: "hello".upper() results in "HELLO".

2. lower():
   - Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
   - Example: "HELLO".lower() results in "hello".

3. strip():
   - Removes leading and trailing whitespace (or specified characters) from the string.
   - Example: "   hello   ".strip() results in "hello".

4. replace(old, new):
   - Replaces all occurrences of a substring (old) with another substring (new).
   - Example: "I love Python".replace("Python", "Java") results in "I love Java".

5. split(delimiter):
   - Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.
   - Example: "apple,banana,grape".split(",") results in ["apple", "banana", "grape"].

6. join(iterable):
   - Joins elements of an iterable (like a list or tuple) into a single string, using the string as a separator.
   - Example: "-".join(["apple", "banana", "grape"]) results in "apple-banana-grape".

7. capitalize():
   - Converts the first character of the string to uppercase, and the rest to lowercase.
   - Example: "python programming".capitalize() results in "Python programming".

8. title():
   - Converts the first character of each word in the string to uppercase.
   - Example: "python programming".title() results in "Python Programming".

9. startswith(substring) and endswith(substring):
   - Check whether a string starts or ends with the specified substring.
   - Example: "Hello".startswith("He") is True, "Hello".endswith("lo") is True.

10. find(substring):
    - Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring. Returns -1 if the substring is not found.
    - Example: "Python is fun".find("fun") results in 10.

11. count(substring):
    - Counts the number of occurrences of a substring within the string.
    - Example: "banana".count("a") results in 3.
