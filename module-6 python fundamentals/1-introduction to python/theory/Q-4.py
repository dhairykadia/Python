"""
Installing Python and setting up the development environment (Anaconda, PyCharm, or VS 
Code). 

-->
    1) Install Python

        step 1: Download Python

            Go to the official Python website.

            Select the version suitable for your operating system(windows, macOS, or Linux)

            For most users, the latest Python 3 versions is recommended.

        step 2: Install Python 

            Run the downloaded installer.
            
            Important: During installation, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH". This ensures Python is accessible from the command line.

        step 3: Verify Installation

            Open a terminal or command prompt.
            
            Type the following command to check the installed Python version:
            
            python --version

            Or use:
            
            python3 --version

    2) Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

        Python can be written in any text editor, but an IDE enhances productivity. Here are popular IDEs:

            Option 1: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

            Download and install VS Code.

            Install the Python extension from the Extensions Marketplace for:

                Code linting

                IntelliSense (code suggestions)

                Debugging support
            
            Option 2: PyCharm

                Download PyCharm.

                Choose the Community Edition (free) or Professional Edition (paid).
