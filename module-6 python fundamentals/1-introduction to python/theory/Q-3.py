"""
Advantages of using Python over other programming languages.

--> 
    1) Easy to Learn and Use 
        
        Simple syntax :  Python's syntax is straightforward and similar to natural language
        making it beginer friendly.

        Reduced Learning Curve : Its minimalistic design allows to write clear and concise 
        code quicklty.

    2) Readability

        Clean Code : Python emphasizes readability, making it easy to understand and maintain.
        
        Fewer lines of code : Tasks that require many files in other languages (e.g. java or C++)
        can often be accomplished with fewer lines of code in python.

    3) Wide Range of Applications 

        Versatility : Python is used in various domains, including :

            Web Development (e.g. Django, Flask)
            Data Science and Machine Learning (e.g. Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow)
            Automation (e.g. selenium PyAutoGUI)
            Scientific Computing (e.g. SciPy, Matplotlib)
            Game Development (e.g. Pygame)
            AI and IOT(Internet Of Things)

        Cross-platform : python is platform-independent and works seamlessly on windows,
        macOS, and Linux.

    4) Extensive Standard Library

        Rich built-in features : Python's standard library provides pre-built modules for
        tasks like :

            Handling files
            Web scraping 
            Data manipulation 
            Networking

        No need for external dependencies : Many tasks can be completed without relying on
        third-party libraries.

    5) Vast ecosystem and libraries 

        Python has an extensive ecosystem of libraries and framework for almost any use case:
        
            Web Development : Django, Flask
            Data Science : Pandas, NumPy
            Machine learning TensorFlow, PyTorch
            Web scraping : BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
    
    6) Community support 

        Active community : Python has one of the largest and most active developer community.

        Open source : It's free and open source, encouraging contributions and rapid development.

        Ample Resources : Developer can find tutorials, forums and documentation to reslove issues.

    7) Community for Beginners
        
        Education-Oriented: Python is often the first language taught in schools and universities because of its simplicity and relevance.
        
        Beginner-Friendly Tools: Tools like Jupyter Notebook make it easy for new developers to experiment and learn.
