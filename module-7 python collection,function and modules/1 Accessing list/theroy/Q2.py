"""
Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing).

--> 

1. Positive Indexing :
- In positive indexing, elements in the list are accessed using numbers starting from 0.
- The first element is at index `0`, the second at `1`, the third at `2`, and so on.
- Positive indexing moves from left to right through the list.

For example: In a list `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`,  
- `"a"` is at index `0`,  
- `"b"` is at index `1`, and so forth.


2. Negative Indexing :
- Negative indexing allows access to elements starting from the end of the list, moving backward.
- The last element is at index `-1`, the second last at `-2`, the third last at `-3`, and so on.

For example: In the same list `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`,  
- `"d"` is at index `-1`,  
- `"c"` is at index `-2`, and so forth.

Key Points to Remember :
- Positive indexing starts from `0` and counts forward.
- Negative indexing starts from `-1` and counts backward.
- Both are used depending on the direction from which you want to access elements in a list.
