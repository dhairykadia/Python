"""
Slicing a list: accessing a range of elements. 

--> 

1. What is Slicing?
- Slicing is the process of retrieving a portion (or subset) of elements from a list.
- It uses the syntax `list_name[start:end]`.
- The `start` index specifies the position to begin slicing (inclusive), and the `end` index specifies the position to stop slicing (exclusive). 

2. Key Rules of Slicing :
- If `start` is omitted, slicing begins from the first element of the list (index `0`).
- If `end` is omitted, slicing continues until the last element of the list.
- Slicing supports both positive and negative indexing to define the range.
- The slicing can also include an optional step value, using the syntax `list_name[start:end:step]`, which controls the increment between indices.

3. Examples of Slicing (Conceptual) :
- For a list `list_name = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`:
  - `list_name[1:4]` retrieves elements at indices `1`, `2`, and `3`, resulting in `[20, 30, 40]`.
  - `list_name[:3]` retrieves elements from the start up to (but not including) index `3`, resulting in `[10, 20, 30]`.
  - `list_name[2:]` retrieves elements starting from index `2` to the end, resulting in `[30, 40, 50]`.

4. Step in Slicing :
- The `step` value determines how elements are skipped during slicing.
- For example:
  - `list_name[::2]` retrieves every second element, resulting in `[10, 30, 50]`.
  - Negative steps (e.g., `list_name[::-1]`) reverse the list.

Slicing is a powerful way to efficiently access specific portions of a list without modifying the original structure.
