"""
Introduction to Python modules and importing modules.

--> Python modules are files containing Python code, usually defining functions, classes, and variables, which can be reused across multiple programs. They are a fundamental building block for writing modular, organized, and maintainable code.

 Key Concepts:
1. What is a Module?
   - A module is simply a Python file (`.py`) that contains definitions and statements.
   - Example: A file named `math_utils.py` with utility functions for mathematical operations can be considered a module.

2. Why Use Modules?
   - They promote code reusability.
   - Help in organizing code logically across multiple files.
   - Avoid duplication and facilitate collaboration.

3. Importing Modules:
   To use a module, you need to import it. Python provides various ways to do this:
   - Basic Import:
     ```
     import module_name
     ```
     This gives access to all the functions and variables defined in the module, using the `module_name.function_name` syntax.

   - Import Specific Items:
     ```
     from module_name import item
     ```
     This imports only the specified function, class, or variable, allowing direct usage without the module prefix.

   - Import with Alias:
     ```
     import module_name as alias
     ```
     This allows you to use a shorthand name for the module.

   - Import All Items (Not recommended):
     ```
     from module_name import *
     ```
     This imports everything from the module but might cause name conflicts.

4. Built-in and External Modules:
   - Python provides several built-in modules (e.g., `math`, `os`, `random`).
   - External modules are third-party packages that can be installed using a package manager like `pip`.
