"""
Merging two lists into a dictionary using loops or zip().

--> Merging two lists into a dictionary can be approached in two main ways:

1. Using Loops:
   - Iterate through the indices of the lists, pairing elements from one list as keys and from the other as values.
   - This method gives flexibility if the two lists have unequal lengths, allowing custom handling for mismatched elements.

2. Using `zip()`:
   - Combine the two lists into pairs using the `zip()` function, which creates an iterable of tuples where each tuple contains one element from each list.
   - This is concise and efficient, but it only pairs elements up to the length of the shorter list.

Both approaches result in a dictionary where the keys come from one list, and the corresponding values come from the other. The choice depends on whether you need simplicity (use `zip()`) or customization (use loops).
