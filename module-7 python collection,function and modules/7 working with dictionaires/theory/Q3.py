"""
Counting occurrences of characters in a string using dictionaries.

--> You can count occurrences of characters in a string using a dictionary by iterating through the string and updating the dictionary.

1. Initialize an empty dictionary:
   - The dictionary will store each character as a key and its count as the corresponding value.

2. Iterate through the string:
   - For each character in the string, check if it already exists as a key in the dictionary.

3. Update counts:
   - If the character exists in the dictionary, increment its value by 1.
   - If not, add it to the dictionary with an initial count of 1.

4. Result:
   - Once the iteration is complete, the dictionary will contain the frequency of each character in the string.

This method is efficient and takes advantage of the dictionary's ability to store and retrieve values based on keys quickly.
