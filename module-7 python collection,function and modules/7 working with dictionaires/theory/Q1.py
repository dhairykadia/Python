"""
Iterating over a dictionary using loops. 

--> In theory, iterating over a dictionary using loops allows you to access its keys, values, or both in an organized manner. A dictionary, as you might know, is a collection of key-value pairs.

Here are the approaches to iterating over a dictionary:

1. Iterating through keys:
   - The default loop through a dictionary accesses the keys.

2. Iterating through values:
   - By using a method provided by the dictionary (e.g., `.values()`), you can loop directly over its values.

3. Iterating through key-value pairs:
   - By utilizing methods like `.items()`, you can access both keys and their associated values at the same time.
