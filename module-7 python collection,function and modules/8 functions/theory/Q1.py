"""
Defining functions in Python.

--> In Python, defining a function involves creating a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

1. Function Definition:
   - Use the `def` keyword to begin defining a function, followed by the function's name.
   - The function name should be descriptive and adhere to naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for separation).

2. Parameters:
   - Functions can take input values called parameters, enclosed within parentheses after the function name.
   - Parameters allow the function to work with dynamic data.

3. Colon and Indentation:
   - After the function's name and parameter list, a colon `:` indicates the start of the function's body.
   - The body is indented and contains the instructions that define what the function does.

4. Optional Return Statement:
   - If the function needs to provide an output, use the `return` statement to send the result back to the caller.

For example, theoretically, a function could represent a mathematical formula, automate repetitive tasks, or encapsulate logic for cleaner and modular code.
