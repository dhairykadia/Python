"""
Different types of functions: with/without parameters, with/without return values.

--> Functions can be categorized based on whether they accept parameters and whether they return values.

1. Functions without Parameters and without Return Values:
   - These functions do not take any input and do not return anything.
   - They typically perform a task, like printing something or updating a variable, but they donâ€™t communicate back to the calling program.

2. Functions without Parameters but with Return Values:
   - These functions do not require input but produce an output via a `return` statement.
   - For example, such a function could calculate and return a constant value.

3. Functions with Parameters and without Return Values:
   - These functions take inputs via parameters to perform an operation but do not return a result.
   - They are useful when the task involves updating or modifying external data based on the provided input.

4. Functions with Parameters and with Return Values:
   - These are the most flexible type of functions as they accept input and provide output.
   - They can process the parameters and return a value to the caller.

Each type of function has its unique use case, depending on the requirements of the task.
